## npm install

Before you can use the table viewer in your application, you'll need to install
the npm module:

```
npm install cdk-dynamo-table-viewer@0.2.46
```

Output should look like this:

```
+ cdk-dynamo-table-viewer@0.2.46
added 1 package from 1 contributor and audited 886517 packages in 6.704s

For  "runtime: lambda.Runtime.NODEJS_16_X" or higher(>NODEJS_16_X), youâ€™ll need to install the npm module:

npm i cdk-dynamo-table-viewer

Now we are ready to add a viewer to our app.
